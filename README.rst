MultiFlowSim
============

**MultiFlowSim** is a Python Library for Multiphase Flow Simulation, powerful and user-friendly Python library designed to streamline the process of modeling and simulating multiphase flow dynamics. Developed with researchers and engineers, our library aims to provide an accessible and efficient tool for a wide range of applications, from oil and gas industry to chemical engineering, environmental engineering, and beyond.

Multiphase flows involve complex interactions between various phases of fluids, such as liquids, gases, and solids. Accurately simulating these 
interactions is crucial for optimizing processes, predicting system behavior, and improving safety measures. MultiFlowSim simplifies this task 
by offering a flexible and modular framework that combines state-of-the-art numerical methods with an intuitive Python interface.

Key features of MultiFlowSim include:

1. A comprehensive suite of numerical solvers tailored for multiphase flow problems.
2. Support for various multiphase flow models, including Vogel.
3. Seamless integration with popular scientific computing libraries, such as NumPy, SciPy, and Plotly, for efficient data processing and visualization.
4. Extensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to help users get started quickly and make the most of MultiFlowSim's capabilities.
5. A robust and active community for support, collaboration, and continuous improvement of the library.
   
Whether you are a seasoned expert in fluid dynamics or just starting to explore the fascinating world of multiphase flows, MultiFlowSim is the 
perfect companion for your research and engineering projects. Join us in our mission to make multiphase flow simulation more accessible and efficient
for everyone.
